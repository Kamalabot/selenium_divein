 Selenium Automation Testing: A Step-by-Step Guide

 1. Understand the Application

 Identify the functionalities: Thoroughly understand the SauceDemo application's features, such as login, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, etc.
 Determine the scope: Define the specific areas you want to test with Selenium.

 2. Create Test Cases
 Use a test case management tool: Tools like TestRail or JIRA can help organize and track test cases.
 Follow a consistent format: Each test case should have a unique ID, a clear description, preconditions, steps, expected results, and actual results.

     2. Verify that previous orders are displayed with correct details.

Additional Test Cases

11. Handle Empty Cart:
12. Handle Out-of-Stock Products:
13. Test Error Handling:
14. Test Cross-Browser Compatibility:
15. Test Mobile Responsiveness:

 4. Execute Test Cases
 Set up the Selenium environment: Install Selenium WebDriver and the appropriate browser drivers.
 Write Selenium scripts: Use programming languages like Java, Python, or C# to automate the test cases.
 Run the tests: Execute the scripts to verify the test cases.

 5. Analyze Results
 Review test results: Compare expected results with actual results.
 Identify defects: Report any discrepancies or failures.

 6. Retest and Close Defects
 Fix identified defects: Work with developers to resolve issues.
 Retest: Run the affected test cases to ensure the defects are fixed.
 Close defects: Mark resolved defects as closed in your test case management tool.

By following these steps and creating comprehensive test cases, you can effectively automate the testing of the SauceDemo application using Selenium, ensuring its quality and reliability.
