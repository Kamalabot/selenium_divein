# Handling Dynamic HTML DOM Elements with XPath

When dealing with HTML DOM elements that change daily, XPath expressions offer flexibility in accessing these elements. Here are some common scenarios in which elements and their values may change, along with the corresponding XPath code to access them.

## 1. Changing Element IDs

### Scenario:

The ID of an element may change daily with a prefix or suffix added, e.g., `button_123`, `button_124`, etc.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//*[starts-with(@id, 'button_')]
```

## 2. Changing Element Class Names

### Scenario:

The class attribute may have dynamic parts, e.g., `class="btn-primary day123"`, `class="btn-primary day124"`.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//*[contains(@class, 'btn-primary')]
```

## 3. Changing Element Text

### Scenario:

The inner text of an element may vary daily, e.g., `<h1>Today's Special Offer</h1>`, `<h1>New Deals Available!</h1>`.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//h1[contains(text(), 'Special Offer') or contains(text(), 'Deals')]
```

## 4. Changing Attribute Values

### Scenario:

An element's attribute value may change slightly, e.g., `<img src="image_day1.png">`, `<img src="image_day2.png">`.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//img[contains(@src, 'image_day')]
```

## 5. Changing Element Positions

### Scenario:

The position of the element within the DOM may change daily, e.g., it might be the first item today and the third tomorrow.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//ul/li[position()=last()]
```

## 6. Changing Parent/Child Structure

### Scenario:

The structure of parent and child elements may vary, e.g., `<div><span id="text1">Text</span></div>` today, and `<section><div><span id="text2">Text</span></div></section>` tomorrow.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//*[text()='Text']
```

## 7. Conditional Attributes

### Scenario:

An element might have different attributes depending on the condition, e.g., `<div data-active="true">Active</div>` vs. `<div data-active="false">Inactive</div>`.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//*[@data-active='true']
```

## 8. Changing Element Tags

### Scenario:

The tag of the element might change, e.g., from `<div>` to `<span>`.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//*[contains(text(),'Important Text')]
```

## 9. Dynamic Lists

### Scenario:

A list of elements where items might be added or removed daily, e.g., `<li>` tags inside an unordered list (`<ul>`).

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//ul/li[contains(text(), 'Item Text')]
```

## 10. Dynamic Data Attributes

### Scenario:

Attributes like `data-*` might change, e.g., `<div data-day="1">` to `<div data-day="2">`.

### XPath Solution:

```xpath
//div[contains(@data-day, 'day')]
```
